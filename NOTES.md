### Blog Ideas
- The Little Checks Matter
- using console.log
- see it with many demos
- probably better and more sophisticated ways, but for newbies, it's great
- grabbing wrong element for likes (button vs p)
- easier to check often after little changes than wait until you have a long block of code to figure out you're not returning what you need
- is there a better way to count what's on the page?
- spaces in the likes
