# PHASE 1 PROJECT - Our Family Recipes
* This application creates a searchable database of family recipes.  You can enter new recipes with a title, chef, family story, ingredients, instructions, inspiration, and category.  The family story makes the application unique and captures what is special about meals we prepare for our families.  You can categorize new recipes by meal course.  You can also see all recipes, filter recipes by category, and clear your recipe view, as well as delete and like recipes.
